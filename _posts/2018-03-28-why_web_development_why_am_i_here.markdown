Though its been a very long time, I remember some of my first coding experiences in school – the process of solving the puzzle, the sense of accomplishment when it all worked, and then recognizing the beauty of an eloquent solution.  (right – I said *beauty* when talking about a program!)

Most of my experience has been in C/C++ and I’ve done just about everything related to software product development.   Along the way, technology has evolved.  So another thing that keeps me in development is that computer programming is continually changing in how we solve problems and the problems we try to solve.

Why am I in a bootcamp?  Well, I want to do web development.   There are so many interesting things going on in this space.   I’m self-taught in a few web technologies – html, css, boostrap, javascript, jquery.   But I want to sharpen those skills and add more tools in my tool box.  Though you can definitely learn things on your own, there are huge benefits when learning from experts and in a community.   

I am now 2 weeks into my bootcamp journey.   Along the way, I hope to share some interesting observations and thoughts
